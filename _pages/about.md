Prof.Dr. Omero Poli-Neto and Prof.Dr. Daniel Tiezzi are the principal investigators of this research group. They are both linked to the Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics from Ribeirao Preto Medical School of the University of Sao Paulo and full advisors of the Gynecological Graduate Program, a note 6 program from Capes.

Our research focuses on PELVIC PAIN & GYNECOLOGICAL TUMORS, especially on the analysis of epidemiological, molecular, and genomic data on a large scale from endometriosis and breast and ovarian cancer. Broadly, we aim to generate new scientific evidences which can impact clinical practice, healthcare and public health policy.

Data science is an emerging and promising field in solving problems that affect humanity. Our group has dipped into this new, challenging and amazing world, trying to contribute to the understanding and, where possible, the solution of epidemiological, biological and computational problems, especially, but not only, those focused on women's health.
