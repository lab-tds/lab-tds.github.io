  title = {Transcriptome meta-analysis reveals differences of immune profile between eutopic endometrium from stage I-{II} and {III}-{IV} endometriosis independently of hormonal milieu},
  journal = {Scientific Reports},
  abstract= {Eutopic endometrium appears to be crucial for endometriosis development. Despite of the evident importance, data regarding the cellular microenvironment remain unclear. Our objective was to explore the tissue microenvironment heterogeneity, transcripts, and pathways that are enriched in all phases of the menstrual cycle by analysing publicly deposited data derived from whole transcriptome microarrays of eutopic endometria of women with and without endometriosis. A meta-analysis of the transcriptome microarrays was performed using raw data available from a public database. Eligibility criteria included eutopic endometrium samples from women with endometriosis and healthy controls without any pathological condition reported the presence of an adequately reported normal menstrual phase, and samples containing both glandular and stromal components. Raw data were processed using a robust multiarray average method to provide background correction, normalisation, and summarisation. The batch effect was estimated by principal variant component analysis and removed using an empirical Bayes method. Cellular tissue heterogeneity was inferred using the xCell package. Differentially expressed genes were identified based on a 5\% adjusted p value and a 2.0-fold change. Pathways were identified by functional enrichment based on the Molecular Signatures Database, a p value of < 5\%, and an FDR q value of ≤ 25\%. Genes that were more frequently found in pathways were identified using leading edge analysis. In a manner independent of cycle phase, the subpopulations of activated dendritic cells, CD4 T effector memory phenotype cells, eosinophils, macrophages M1, and natural killer T cells (NKT) were all higher in stage I-II endometriosis compared to those in healthy controls. The subpopulations of M2 macrophages and natural killer T cells were elevated in eutopic endometriums from women with stage III-IV endometriosis, and smooth muscle cells were always more prevalent in healthy eutopic endometriums. Among the differently expressed genes, FOS, FOSB, JUNB, and EGR1 were the most frequently mapped within the interaction networks, and this was independent of stage and cycle phase. The enriched pathways were directly related to immune surveillance, stem cell self-renewal, and epithelial mesenchymal transition. PI3K AKT mTOR, TGF signalling, and interferon alpha/gamma responses were enriched exclusively in stage III-IV endometriosis. The cellular microenvironments and immune cell profiles were different between eutopic endometriums from women with stage I-II and stage III-IV endometriosis, and these differences were independent of the hormonal milieu. Specifically, a pro-inflammatory profile was predominant in stage I-II endometriosis, and M1-M2 polarization into eutopic endometrium may be crucial for the progression of the disease. The higher prevalence of NKT cells in eutopic endometriums from women with endometriosis that was independent of cycle phase or staging suggested a sustained stress and/or damage to these eutopic endometriums. Based on this, the results of this meta-analysis are important for identifying challenges and opportunities for future research.},

  abstract = {Cervical cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Reported here is an extensive molecular characterization of 228 primary cervical cancers, the largest comprehensive genomic study of cervical cancer to date. We observed striking APOBEC mutagenesis patterns and identified SHKBP1, ERBB3, CASP8, HLA-A, and TGFBR2 as novel significantly mutated genes in cervical cancer. We also discovered novel amplifications in immune targets CD274/PD-L1 and PDCD1LG2/PD-L2, and the BCAR4 lncRNA that has been associated with response to lapatinib. HPV integration was observed in all HPV18-related cases and 76\% of HPV16-related cases, and was associated with structural aberrations and increased target gene expression. We identified a unique set of endometrial-like cervical cancers, comprised predominantly of HPV-negative tumors with high frequencies of KRAS, ARID1A, and PTEN mutations. Integrative clustering of 178 samples identified Keratin-low Squamous, Keratin-high Squamous, and Adenocarcinoma-rich subgroups. These molecular analyses reveal new potential therapeutic targets for cervical cancers.},

This study evaluated if axillary ultrasound (US) coupled with fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) can accurately predict clinically relevant node metastasis in patients with breast cancer, and thus assist clinical decisions},
