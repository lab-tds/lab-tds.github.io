[Dr. ISABELA PANZERI CARLOTTI BUZATTO]() presented at the [Brazilian Breast Cancer Symposium 2023](https://2023.bbcs.org.br/speaker/isabela-panzeri-carlotti-buzatto-bra/) the results of her study conducted with the partnership Laboratory for Translational Data Science entitled Axillary ultrasound and fine-needle aspiration cytology to predict clinically relevant nodal burden in breast cancer patients where it was observed that Machine learning can reliably predict the malignancy of BI-RADS; 4a and 4b breast lesions based on clinical and ultrasonographic features. The work was [awarded](https://2023.bbcs.org.br/jose-aristodemo-pinotti-award/) by the Brazilian Society of Mastology and will be presented at an International Congress in Italy

Objective: To establish the most reliable machine learning model to predict malignancy in BI- RADS; 4a and 4b breast lesions, and optimize the negative predictive value to minimize unnecessary biopsies. Methodology: We included clinical and ultrasonographic attributes from 1,250 breast lesions from four Institutions classified as BI-RADS; 3 , 4a, 4b, 4c, 5 and 6. We selected the most informative attributes to train the models in order to make inferences about the diagnosis of BI-RADS; 4a and 4b lesions (validation dataset). Using the best parameters and hyperparameters selected we tested the performance of nine models and 1530 ensemble models.
Results: The most informative attributes were shape, margin, orientation and size of the lesions, the resistance index of the internal vessel, the age of the patient and the presence of a palpable lump. The highest mean NPV was achieved with XGBoost (93.6%).The final performance of the best ensemble model was: NPV= 96.4%, sensitivity= 81.5%, specificity= 84.1%, PPV= 46.8%, f1-score= 59.5% and the final accuracy= 83.7%. Age was the most important attribute to predict malignancy. The use of the final model associated with the patient’s age would reduce in 51% the number of biopsies in women with BI-RADS; 4a or 4b lesions. Conclusion: Machine learning can predict malignancy in BI-RADS; 4a and 4b breast lesions identified by
the US, based on clinical and ultrasonographic features. Our final prediction model would be able to avoid 51% of the 4a and 4b breast biopsies, without missing any cancers.
